# File Organizer and Deduplicator

The **File Organizer and Deduplicator** is a Python script designed to help users efficiently manage their files. This tool scans a specified directory, categorizes files based on their types, and moves them into corresponding subfolders. Supported file types include images, documents, videos, audio files, applications, and archives. Additionally, the tool features a deduplication function that identifies and removes duplicate files, ensuring that at least one copy of each file type is retained. üìÅ‚ú®
